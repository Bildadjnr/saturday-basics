-start my day early. 
-champions think like champions before they become champions.
- I dont stop when i am tired, I stop when I am done. 
-winners never quit. they are obsessed with their craft. 
-my philosophy is, why be normal when you can be the best. I dont want to be normal. I want to be the best.
